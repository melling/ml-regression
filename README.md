# Machine Learning Regression with Kaggle House Prices

This is a deep dive into learning to solve machine learning regression problems.  Supervised learning with a continuous target value.

The data set used is from the the Kaggle Competition [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques)

Given several dozen predictors/featues, we want to accurately predict the sale price of a house.
